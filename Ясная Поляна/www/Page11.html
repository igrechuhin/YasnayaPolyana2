            It would be difficult to&nbsp;find another place where, quite so literally as&nbsp;at&nbsp;the&nbsp;Yasnaya Polyana Museum-Estate of&nbsp;Leo Tolstoy, we can sense such a&nbsp;"genius of place". Here, nothing has been changed since the&nbsp;day of&nbsp;the&nbsp;death of&nbsp;the&nbsp;great writer in&nbsp;1910; this&nbsp;museum exists thanks to&nbsp;the&nbsp;efforts of&nbsp;Sofia Tolstaya, the&nbsp;writer's wife, who preserved every tiny element the&nbsp;way it&nbsp;was&nbsp;during Tolstoy's life, writing detailed descriptions, captions and&nbsp;inventories. The&nbsp;baton was&nbsp;passed&nbsp;on&nbsp;to&nbsp;her daughters, granddaughters and&nbsp;then great-great-grandsons, who have&nbsp;preserved this "noble nest" over the&nbsp;last century. Leo Tolstoi lived here for&nbsp;almost 50&nbsp;years; it&nbsp;was&nbsp;here that he was&nbsp;born, he grew&nbsp;up; it&nbsp;was to&nbsp;this place that he came with his young wife, he ran the&nbsp;estate here, hunted, created schools for&nbsp;the&nbsp;peasant children; it&nbsp;was here that he wrote the&nbsp;bulk of&nbsp;his works; and&nbsp;it&nbsp;was this place that he left shortly before his death. The&nbsp;house in&nbsp;Yasnaya Polyana still looks the&nbsp;same, one hundred years after the&nbsp;death of&nbsp;its master - every trifle and&nbsp;detail in&nbsp;the&nbsp;life of&nbsp;this house, whether it&nbsp;be&nbsp;the&nbsp;paper on&nbsp;Tolstoy's table or&nbsp;the&nbsp;tangles of&nbsp;threads in&nbsp;Sofia Tolstaya's workbox, lies exactly where it has always lain, creating a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;vibrant home of&nbsp;a&nbsp;large family. At&nbsp;the&nbsp;same time, the&nbsp;museum's staff, incredibly, combine a&nbsp;reverent regard for&nbsp;the&nbsp;writer's legacy and&nbsp;daily care for&nbsp;this large enterprise. It&nbsp;is an&nbsp;enterprise that has&nbsp;never ceased to&nbsp;function, with&nbsp;the&nbsp;exception of&nbsp;40&nbsp;days of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Nazi invasion; here they continue to&nbsp;plough the&nbsp;soil, to&nbsp;sow and&nbsp;to&nbsp;reap the&nbsp;harvest, tending the&nbsp;forest and&nbsp;the&nbsp;orchards in&nbsp;strict accordance with&nbsp;the&nbsp;rules established back during the&nbsp;time of&nbsp;Leo Tolstoy, rearing horses and&nbsp;cows of&nbsp;the&nbsp;same breed as&nbsp;was&nbsp;done during his day. Fyokla Tolstaya, journalist and&nbsp;great-great-granddaughter of&nbsp;the&nbsp;great writer, provides an&nbsp;insight into&nbsp;this unique museum, giving it a&nbsp;personal intonation.
