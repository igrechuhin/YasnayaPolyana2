            It would be difficult to find another place where, quite so literally as at the Yasnaya Polyana Museum-Estate of Leo Tolstoy, we can sense such a "genius of place". Here, nothing has been changed since the day of the death of the great writer in 1910; this museum exists thanks to the efforts of Sofia Tolstaya, the writer's wife, who preserved every tiny element the way it was during Tolstoy's life, writing detailed descriptions, captions and inventories. The baton was passed on to her daughters, granddaughters and then great-great-grandsons, who have preserved this "noble nest" over the last century. Leo Tolstoi lived here for almost 50 years; it was here that he was born, he grew up; it was to this place that he came with his young wife, he ran the estate here, hunted, created schools for the peasant children; it was here that he wrote the bulk of his works; and it was this place that he left shortly before his death. The house in Yasnaya Polyana still looks the same, one hundred years after the death of its master - every trifle and detail in the life of this house, whether it be the paper on Tolstoy's table or the tangles of threads in Sofia Tolstaya's workbox, lies exactly where it has always lain, creating a sense of vibrant home of a large family. At the same time, the museum's staff, incredibly, combine a reverent regard for the writer's legacy and daily care for this large enterprise. It is an enterprise that has never ceased to function, with the exception of 40 days of the Nazi invasion; here they continue to plough the soil, to sow and to reap the harvest, tending the forest and the orchards in strict accordance with the rules established back during the time of Leo Tolstoy, rearing horses and cows of the same breed as was done during his day. Fyokla Tolstaya, journalist and great-great-granddaughter of the great writer, provides an insight into this unique museum, giving it a personal intonation.
